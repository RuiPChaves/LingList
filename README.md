# LingList
LingList posts tally.

Analysis of the LingLite posts at http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/linglite/ (which must be downloaded and decompressed into an /email folder)

Most job posts mention multiple specializations (e.g. Phonetics/Phonology, or Syntax/Semantics, or Computational [field]), which means that the jobs tallied here the number of opportunities from applicants' perspective, which are inflated relative to the true number of job positions.

Python code orginally written by Tom Juzek (http://tsjuzek.com/blog/jobs_in_linguistics.html) for Python 2 (2017).
Adapted to Python 3, and expanded by Rui Chaves (2019-2021).
