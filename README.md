# LingList
LingList posts tally.

Analysis of the LingLite posts at http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/linglite/ (which must be downloaded and decompressed into an /email folder)

Most job posts mention multiple specializations (e.g. Phonetics/Phonology, or Syntax/Semantics, or Computational [field]), which means that the jobs tallied here the number of opportunities from applicants' perspective, which are inflated relative to the true number of job positions.

# Python code "script.py" was orginally written by Tom Juzek (http://tsjuzek.com/blog/jobs_in_linguistics.html) for Python 2 (2017).
Adapted to Python 3, and expanded by Rui Chaves (2019-2021).
This code is not optimized in any shape or form.
The "script.py" file generates "jobs.csv", which can be analyzed and plotted via "jobsgraph.r"

# The Bash code "raw_jobs.sh" extracts raw job post tallies, per year, avoiding the inflation described above. This creates "raw_jobs.csv" and can be plotted via "raw_jobsgraph.r".

All R code by Rui Chaves.
